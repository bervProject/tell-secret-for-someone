# Tell Secret Message For Her!
Your Message for Her Still Secret in Here! Don't Worry to Tell Here. :p

## Roadmap (Early Version) Feature for 1.0

1. Using some Encryption Method to save the Message into Database
2. For public access, can access all messages! But with encrypted message.
3. For open message, need key to decrypt.
4. Basic ability: One Method for One "Text"/"Document"
5. Encrypted message hard to decrypt with any analysis tools
6. Use single key based encryption.

## Early Version 1.0 Architecture

1. Use different service for FrontEnd and BackEnd. FrontEnd will use React.js and BackEnd will use Feathers.js.

## Next Release Feature 2.0

1. Different method each "paragraph".
2. Different key each "paragraph".
3. Use multiple encryption.
4. Use public/private key feature option.

## Hold Feature (Need help feature)
